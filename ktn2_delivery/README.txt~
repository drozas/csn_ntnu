This file contains the project for the course TTM4100, consisting of:
- src: whole source code. The protocol is implemented in ConnectionImplementation, but we have decided to include the whole code because we add/modify some of the files in order to test during development stage (ex.: change the chat client to take a parameter from the prompt which is the number of the port, in order to be able to run many of them easily).
- doc: changes to the previous documentation. The changes performed are summarized in the introduction.
- test: We used the bundled client and server for testing since we had problems using JUnit on the code. The code related to the attempt to use JUnit is provided anyway.
	We tested the system with no errors, 10% and 50% in each of the error cathegories. We also ran tests on everyone at 10% and everything on 50%. In order to test how it will run on a mobile phone behind a NAT (like most phones are) another scenario is: package loss 30%, package delayed 60%, error payload 40% and error header 28%.We also tested everything on 80% as a  worst case scenario to see if our implementation could take a beating.
We design our protocol to raise an ConnectException when the network has achieved a big amount of mistakes, so in some of the cases this exception can be raised. This is supposed to be catched by the application.
